## Steps to Reach Feature Parity
1. **Complete all dashboard and booking pages for each role**
2. **Implement multi-language support throughout the app**
3. **Wire up all forms and data tables to your backend (no placeholders)**
4. **Test all flows (booking, management, notifications, etc.)**
5. **Polish UI for consistency, responsiveness, and accessibility**
6. **Deploy and verify with real data**

---

**All enhancements and new files should go in the `app/enhancements/` and `lib/enhancements/` folders for easy tracking and modularity.**
