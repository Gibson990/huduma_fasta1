### Final Suggestions for Handoff & Future Work
- Double-check that all migration and seed SQL scripts are up to date and included.
- Ensure all code is committed and pushed to your remote repository.
- Include a README with:
  - How to install dependencies
  - How to run migrations
  - How to start the app
  - Any environment variables needed (e.g., DB connection)
- If possible, include a sample `.env.example` file.
- List any known issues or TODOs for future work (e.g., chat/report UI, notifications, provider subscription model).
- Test the app on a clean machine to confirm setup instructions are complete.

**You are now ready to push, deploy, and continue development or testing on any machine!**
